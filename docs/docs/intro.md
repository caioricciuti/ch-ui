## ü§î Why CH-UI?

[ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com) is an incredibly **THE BEST** OLAP database, after years working with proprietary DB's I had no
idea that an open-source database could be so powerful, but it is, and it's amazing. The command line interface is great, but it's not for everyone, and that's where CH-UI comes in.

NOTE: This is not a Click House project, it's a personal project, I'm not affiliated with Click House in any way, I just love it.

## üõ† How It Works

CH-UI is built on my best knowledge. It's a full-stack application that leverages the power of modern web technologies to deliver a seamless user experience.

2. Client sends requests to the server via REST API

4. Server sends data back to the client
5. Client displays data in a user-friendly format
