# Getting Started üöÄ

Let's start with **CH-UI in less than 5 minutes**.

## Prerequisites

- A running ClickHouse server instance [ClickHouse Official Installation Guide](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/install#quick-install)

## üê≥ Docker

You can deploy CH-UI in a few minutes using Docker. Just run the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 5521:5521 ghcr.io/caioricciuti/ch-ui:latest
```

We also have a docker-compose file that you can use to deploy CH-UI. Just create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
services:
  ch-ui:
    image: ghcr.io/caioricciuti/ch-ui:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "${CH_UI_PORT:-5521}:5521"
    environment:
      VITE_CLICKHOUSE_URL: "http://your-clickhouse-server:8123"
      VITE_CLICKHOUSE_USER: "your-username"
      VITE_CLICKHOUSE_PASS: "your-password"
```

And then run:

```bash
# use -d to run in detached mode
docker-compose up -d
```

Environment variables:

- `VITE_CLICKHOUSE_URL`: ClickHouse server URL (optional)
- `VITE_CLICKHOUSE_USER`: ClickHouse user (optional)
- `VITE_CLICKHOUSE_PASS`: ClickHouse password (optional)

## üíª Build from source

You can also build CH-UI from source.
