## What is CH-UI?

You guessed it - this is the very first post on CH-UI's blog, and I'm super excited to kick things off ðŸŽ‰

Alright, let me break it down for you in simple terms. You know ClickHouse, that super-fast database system that can crunch through tons of data like it's nothing? Well, CH-UI is basically a fancy dress for ClickHouse. It's a UI that makes ClickHouse easy to use via a web browser.

## Why did I create it?

Here's the thing... ClickHouse is amazing, but when you have a project, or a group of people, or even if you want your super unicorn start-up to be able to use "BIG-DATA, AI-DRIVEN, DATA-DRIVEN" solutions, data needs to be accessible to everyone. Queries need to be easy to write, and results need to be easy to understand, see, and get insights from... ClickHouse itself offers a cloud-based solution, and [I **really** recommend it](https://clickhouse.com/cloud?utm_source=ch-ui&utm_medium=blog). They even give you free credits and **LOTS** of features...

After using their cloud solution, I was amazed by all the features and the speed of the database, but the time had come. It was 26 days into my trial... The clock was ticking!

Then the thought:

> "How am I going to leave without an answer for my NYC taxi ride questions!? I CAN'T LOSE MY DATA!!! What if I don't have time to figure out how many rides from Brooklyn to the airport happened?!"

I couldn't bear not knowing! And [that's why I couldn't lose my data](/blog/posts/why-i-couldnt-lose-my-data).

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  **THE IDEA!** - What if I could create a UI that connects to ClickHouse, then
  self-host it on my own and have all the taxi data I wanted forever?!
</Callout>

Well, that's how CH-UI was born! ðŸš€

## What can you do with CH-UI?

Clearly, the main goal is to see all the taxi rides from Brooklyn to the airport... BUT if you want to do anything else, even though I don't see the point... You can:

- Browse your databases and tables on the data explorer.
- Write and run queries with a nice SQL editor.
- View your data in tables, filter, sort, and export it.
- Get insights from your data much easier.
- See your instance metrics.

## Final thoughts...

I really hope this can be a true solution for anyone who wants to start with ClickHouse, or even for those who already **self-host** it and want a better way to interact with the data...

I also hope that technical people who use CH-UI get involved in the project so it can grow to be better... Personally, I think data is extremely valuable for **EVERYONE**, not just big companies that can pay, or people who are starting to learn. I truly believe that we should be able to create solutions as a community, and I want to see all kinds of companies, professionals, and students using CH-UI and having a really good experience with it.

So, that's it for now! I hope you enjoy using CH-UI as much as I enjoyed creating it. And remember, if you have any questions, feedback, or just want to chat about ClickHouse, feel free to reach out! ðŸš€
