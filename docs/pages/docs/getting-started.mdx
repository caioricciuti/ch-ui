# Getting Started üöÄ

Let's get you up and running with CH-UI in no time.

## Prerequisites

- A running ClickHouse server instance. If you don't have one, follow the [ClickHouse Official Installation Guide](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/install#quick-install).

## üê≥ Using Docker

Deploy CH-UI quickly using Docker:

```bash copy
docker run -p 5521:5521 ghcr.io/caioricciuti/ch-ui:latest
```

### Using Environment Variables with Docker

CH-UI supports setting ClickHouse connection details using environment variables:

```bash copy
docker run -p 5521:5521 \
  -e VITE_CLICKHOUSE_URL=http://your-clickhouse-server:8123 \
  -e VITE_CLICKHOUSE_USER=your-username \
  -e VITE_CLICKHOUSE_PASS=your-password \
  ghcr.io/caioricciuti/ch-ui:latest
```

### Using docker-compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file (or use the one provided in the repository):

```yaml copy
services:
  ch-ui:
    image: ghcr.io/caioricciuti/ch-ui:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "${CH_UI_PORT:-5521}:5521"
    environment:
      VITE_CLICKHOUSE_URL: "http://your-clickhouse-server:8123" # OPTIONAL
      VITE_CLICKHOUSE_USER: "your-username" # OPTIONAL
      VITE_CLICKHOUSE_PASS: "your-password" # OPTIONAL
```

Then run:

```bash copy
docker-compose up # use -d to run in detached mode
```

## üíª Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash copy
   git clone https://github.com/caioricciuti/ch-ui.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash copy
   cd ch-ui
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash copy
   npm run build
   ```

4. Preview the build:
   ```bash copy
   npm run preview
   ```

   Or run in debug mode:
   ```bash copy
   npm run dev
   ```

## Using docker-compose to run a localhost clickhouse (only for development)

The following command will run a clickhouse database with a connection to http://localhost:8123 and a user `dev` with password `dev`.
The data will be persisted in this directory: `.clickhouse_local_data`

```bash copy
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d
```

Use the following command to turn down, don't forget to remove `.clickhouse_local_data` if you want to save some space in your HD but then all data will be erased.

```bash copy
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml down
```

## Security Recommendations

For production use, consider implementing these security measures:

1. Use a reverse proxy with authentication (e.g., Nginx with basic auth).
2. Enable HTTPS to encrypt all traffic.
3. Implement IP whitelisting if possible.
4. Keep all components up to date.
5. Configure a firewall to restrict incoming connections.

Refer to the full README for detailed security configuration examples.

## Next Steps

1. Connect to your ClickHouse server through the Settings page.
2. Explore databases and tables using the Database Explorer.
3. Write and execute SQL queries in the SQL Editor.
4. Organize your work using Workspace Tabs.
